   abstract = {Abstract While \{BIM\} processes are established for new
buildings, the majority of existing buildings is not
maintained, refurbished or deconstructed with \{BIM\} yet.
Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate
research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and
deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due
to rapid developments in \{BIM\} research, involved
stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of \{BIM\}
implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper
presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the
topic. Results show scarce \{BIM\} implementation in existing
buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high
modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into
semantic \{BIM\} objects, (2) updating of information in
\{BIM\} and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and
relations in \{BIM\} occurring in existing buildings. Despite
fast developments and spreading standards, challenging
research opportunities arise from process automation and
\{BIM\} adaption to existing buildings' requirements.},

@article{BEKS14,
   abstract =    {The Julia programming language is gaining enormous
popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most
importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions
widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level,
dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature.
2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then
recode in another language. 3. There are parts of a system
for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as
they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep
understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and
the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that
have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from
computer science and computational science creating a new
approach to scientific computing. This note introduces the
programmer to the language and the underlying design
theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental
foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular,
there is the fascinating dance between specialization and
abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We
can pick just the right algorithm for the right
circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on
argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch).
Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after
differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant.
The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse
(generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible
power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many
explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most
importantly, human convenience.},
