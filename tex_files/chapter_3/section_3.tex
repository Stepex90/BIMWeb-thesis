\section{Propriet\'a Specifiche}
\label{sec:chapter_3_section_3}

\noindent
Each plugin has a set of specific properties of the building elements it represents.
Each property is defined by (1) a \emph{name}, (2) a \emph{type}, such as ``number'', ``text'', ``boolean'', or ``custom'', and by  (3) a \emph{value}.
According to its type, each property value can be inserted in different ways.
For example, a boolean property value is set through a checkbox, while a textual property is set through a text box.

The system is designed to accept custom kinds of property. A custom property is required to define the component of the UI that permits the user to insert its value.
For example, a ``color'' property can be introduced by defining a UI component composed by three text boxes (one for each RGB components), while a ``length'' property can be introduced by defining a UI component including a text box for the value and a drop-down menu for the unit of measure.

The specific properties of an element can be edited in the relative panel in the sidebar, once the element is selected in the canvas.
